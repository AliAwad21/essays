**annotations**
 Since the annoation function is not working, I will just write where the annotations are supposed to go. 1) is the text of ya viene to the head on the far left saying it, ya viene means "its comming" in spanish. this is most likley in rerefence to as already described, Western and European views of Natives, and other people of the third world, and native art being dehumanizing. 1) is the text of ya viene to the head on the far left saying it, ya viene means "its comming" in spanish. this is most likley in rerefence to as already described, Western and European views of Natives, and other people of the third world, and native art being dehumanizing. is the text of ya viene to the head on the far left saying it, ya viene means "its comming" in spanish. this is most likley in rerefence to as already described, Western and European views of Natives, and other people of the third world, and native art being dehumanizing.is the text of ya viene to the head on the far left saying it, ya viene means "its comming" in spanish. this is most likley in rerefence to as already described, Western and European views of Natives, and other people of the third world, and native art being dehumanizing. 2) the head of the main person. this is most likley in reference to some native american head wear of a wolf pelt, this is shown more clearly in other art from Josie bedia, 3) the frills underneath the head this further is more evidence of the wolf pelt as it resembles fur, especially with the soft brushing of the charcoal. 4) the muscles of the leg of the main person, this disrporportionate form and monsterous proportions is in reference to the european again and the dehumanization of natives, the person as we see them is seen through the eyes of the european. 5) the box the person is surrounded in, this is most likely a bentwood box, a form of native art, art that is viewed upon again by europeans as less civilized. this attitude is perceived as "technological vanity." by Jose Bedia.

**Ya Viene** portrays a native person surrounded in their [art and culture](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q979300) and portrayed to us in a [monsterous](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3495037)  (^4) and terrifying and disproportionate in form. this form however in reality is the European's view as shown to the far left, who claims ""its" coming.". The word "its" gives us an understanding of the europeans view of the native person. Of their art and culture. To Jose Bedia, he takes from multiple sources of art. From latin american to native and african, from [opressed people](https://www.artnet.com/artists/jos%C3%A9-bedia/), from people whos art is shunned by traditional art establishments. This snobbish/elitist and ultimatly racist view of art is to Jose bedia ["technological vanity"](https://mlagallery.com/collections/jose-bedia?srsltid=AfmBOopWZTaAegzW1dybOYz1pWK29ZZCTohEYvdYZL2TP0lqj0l7Y6kR).

# Plains Native Drawings
.ve-media https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VA7IN1DI9o

In this video Jose Bedia shows some drawings of plains natives [inspired from real world events](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2791) and the reasoning for their depictions. Mainly deriving from a drawing towards these depictions of people that are often in classical art not focused on. However soon after there is shown a piece of african art of a mask. He, in his classical art education relates it to [cubism](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42934) and works of Picasso. (^2)

# A focus on Indigenous Art
.ve-media https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFAhezPIeBM

In this video, there is explained the reason for why Jose Bedia often depicts native art through their orignal mediums or [motiffs](https://moisesvaldes.com/product-category/bedia-jose/). Mainly to put a focus and spotlight to art and people that are often [disregarded](https://www.amerinda.org/newsletter/6-2/misunderstood.htm) in their culture by classical art training. (^3)

# The Method
.ve-media https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcalQaIzpFw

In this video Jose Bedia explains the method for how his art is inspired and created. Mainly from [living in the cultures](https://josebedia.com/biography/) and tribes that are the inspiration and learning of the methods and techniques used in the creation of their art.  (^5)
